# MERN Admin Dashboard

Building a MERN Stack Admin Dashboard. For frontend, I used Material UI, Material UI Data Grid, Nivo Charts, Redux Toolkit and Redux Toolkit Query. For backend, I used Node JS, Express Js, Mongoose, and MongoDB. This will also show how to Data Model using Entity Relationship Diagrams as well as making aggregate calls in MongoDB.

- Install the required dependencies for both client and server: `npm install`
- Setup mongodb database and add url to `.env` file configuration and insert data into the database in file `server/index.js`
- Run both the applications simultaneously: client `npm run dev` and server `npm run dev`
- View the application on the browser using `http://localhost:5173`
