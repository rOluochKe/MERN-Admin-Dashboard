# MERN Admin Dashboard

Building a MERN Stack Admin Dashboard. For frontend, I used Material UI, Material UI Data Grid, Nivo Charts, Redux Toolkit and Redux Toolkit Query. For backend, I used Node JS, Express Js, Mongoose, and MongoDB. This will also show how to Data Model using Entity Relationship Diagrams as well as making aggregate calls in MongoDB.
